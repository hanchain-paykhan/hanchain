### HanChain's tokenomics start with the real-world ecosystem, not with an initial coin offering (ICO). This is a unique feature that emphasizes HanChain's ability to be used in real life.

# HanChainâ€™s tokens are divided into two parts: REWARD and ePlatform.
### REWARD tokens are rewarded for staking Music Copyrights or staking HanChain tokens to provide liquidity for the copyright exchange.
### ePlatform tokens are airdropped to users who participate in HanChain's real-world ecosystem to provide liquidity for HanChain's decentralized exchange (DEX). Additionally, 50-75% of the supplied liquidity (LP tokens) is locked for more than a year through staking.
### This is intended to stabilize the value of HanChain and promote the growth of HanChain's real-world ecosystem. 

HanChain's tokenomics are unique and attractive in that they start with the use of the real-world ecosystem and provide utility tokens that can be used in real life.

### All tokens except the initial circulating supply and the 365-day staking lock are locked in the tokenVestingLock contract, which has been audited by Certik.
